## Task Descriptions

### TASK 1 - Titanic Classification
This notebook implements a classification model to predict whether a Titanic passenger survived or not.  
**Objectives:**  
- Analyze the factors affecting survival such as age, gender, socio-economic status, and more.  
- Perform data preprocessing and handle missing values.  
- Build and evaluate classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression).

The `train.csv` file contains the raw data used for training.

---

### TASK 2 - Stock Price Prediction
This notebook uses an LSTM model to predict the future stock price of a company (example: Apple - AAPL).  
**Objectives:**  
- Download and preprocess historical stock price data.  
- Build an LSTM model for time series prediction.  
- Predict stock prices for the next 30 days.  
- Add technical indicators (RSI, MACD) for deeper analysis.

The files `AAPL_stock_data.csv` and `lstm_stock_model.keras` contain the historical stock data and the trained model respectively.

## Prerequisites and Installation

This project requires Python 3.x and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Usage

1. **Task 1**
   Open and run `Task1_Titanic_Classification/Titanic Survival.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

2. **Task 2**
   Open and run `Task2_Stock_Prediction/stock_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Notes

* This project is for educational purposes as part of the CodeAlpha challenge.
* Stock price predictions are inherently uncertain and should **not** be used for real investment decisions.
